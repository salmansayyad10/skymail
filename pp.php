 <font class="align">When you use Smail services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. And remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security at My Account.</font>
 
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 <font class="align">
There are many different ways you can use our services to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Smail Account, we can make those services even better to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</font><br><br><br>
<h2>Our Privacy Policy explains:</h2><br>

<ul>	What information we collect and why we collect it.</ul>
<ul>	How we use that information.</ul>
<ul>	The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</ul>
<br>

 <font class="align">  We tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you are not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Smail so whether you are new to Smail or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices and if you have any questions contact us</font>
 
 <br /><br /><br>
<h2>Information we collect</h2><br />
<font class="align">We collect information to provide better services to all of our users  to more complex things like which ads you will find most useful, the people who matter most to you online.</font>
<br><br><br>
<h2>We collect information in the following ways:</h2><br>
<ul>	Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Smail Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. </ul>
<ul>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, l</ul>
<h2>Log information</h2>
When you use our services or view content provided by Smail, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:
<ul>	details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</ul>
<ul>	telephony log information like your Mail address,forwarding mails, time and date of mail</ul>
<br>

<h2>How we use information we collect</h2><br />
<font class="align">We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Smail and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
We may use the name you provide for your Smail Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Smai; Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Smail Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Smail Profile information, such as your name and photo.</font><br /><br />


<h2>Information you share</h2><br />
<font class="align">Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Smial. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.</font>
<br /><br /><br />

<h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2><br />
<font class="align">Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it  unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
